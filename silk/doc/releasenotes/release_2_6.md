Hi all,

we are happy to announce version 2.6 of the Silk Link Discovery Framework.

The Silk framework is a tool for discovering relationships between data items within different Linked Data sources. Data publishers can use Silk to set RDF links from their data sources to other data sources on the Web. Using the declarative Silk – Link Specification Language (Silk-LSL), developers can specify the linkage rules data items must fulfill in order to be interlinked. These linkage rules may combine various similarity metrics and can take the graph around a data item into account, which is addressed using an RDF path language.

What’s new:

- A new version of the Silk Workbench, a web application that guides the user through the process of interlinking different data sources. Silk Workbench has been improved in many respects and now includes a REST API and even more distance measures and data transformations.

- A plugin system for extending Silk with additional behavour. This allows users to add new data sources, transformations, distance measures etc.

- A first version of the Silk Free Text Preprocessor for producing a structured representation for linking from free text.

The Silk framework is provided under the terms of the Apache License, Version 2.0. More information about the Silk Link Discovery Framework is available at: http://silk.wbsg.de

Happy linking,

The Silk Team
