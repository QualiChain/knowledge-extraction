# Configuration

The configuration is located in the `conf` folder in the root directory. The default configuration is shipped in the `reference.conf` file. The configuration can be customized by adding a `application.conf` file, which may override configuration options. By the default, the `application.conf` file is searched for in the `conf` folder.  A different search folder for `application.conf` can be configured using one of the following system properties:

- `config.resource` specifies a different file name than `application.conf`.
- `config.file` specifies a filesystem path, including the full file name.
- `config.url` specifies a URL.

If the Workbench is not running standalone, but packaged as War or Docker, the `conf` folder is not directly accessible. In that case, please set one of the above system properties to point to your custom external configuration file.

The configuration format is based on [HOCON](https://github.com/typesafehub/config).
