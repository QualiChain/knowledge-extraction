<http://wdc.org/resource/11> <http://schema.org/Product/description> "The second generation of Apple's magical device that practically invented the tablet computer category, the iPad 2 featues a dual-core processor, faster graphics and two cameras, all in a smaller, lighter body, but with the friendly, yet powerful user experience that made the original so popular.  The build quality is exceptional, with the one-piece aluminum body feeling great in your hands. The screen size is the same 9.7 inches as before, but the iPad 2 is slimmer and lighter than it's predecessor, weighing 601g and measuring 33% thinner at an eye-poppingly skinny 8.8mm. Inside there is a new processor, Apple's A5, which means the iPad 2 is fast, seriously fast. The iPad 2 has twice the processing power and up to nine-times the graphic speed of the original iPad, so it runs faster, handles apps better, and boasts much greater graphic capabilities. This is all achieved without increasing the power requirements, so the iPad 2 still delivers an impressive 10 hours of constant use.  The iPad 2 comes with the latest Apple operating system, iOS 4.3, featuring a much improved Safari performance for web browsing, as well as FaceTime and PhotoBooth apps which take advantage of the new dual cameras. The front-facing camera is used with Apple's FaceTime, which lets you make video calls to any other Apple device using the app, and the rear-camera lets you capture HD video at 720p quality. The iPad uses the same interface as before; a user-friendly system, instantly familiar to anyone who's used an iPod touch or iPhone, and easy enough for everyone to pick up and play with.  Features you'll love:    New design that is lighter and 33% thinner than the original iPad   Dual-core A5 processor provides blazingly fast performance and stunning graphics   Dual cameras for video calls and capturing HD video   HDMI output to see you iPad display on your TV   Friendly navigation; get to grips with your iPad 2 quickly and easily   Choose from over 65,000 versatile apps designed especially for the iPad, and run the full selection of over 350,000 apps from Apple's App Store   iTunes, with access to a huge digital marketplace for movies, TV shows and music   New white variant of the iPad 2, with both 3G and Wi-Fi as well as 16GB of internal memory    What we say:  â€œ Faster, lighter, thinner, but still as incredibly responsive and intuitive to use as before, Apple's small but important upgrades should keep the iPad 2 comfortably ahead as the most desired tablet computer on the market for both tech-geeks and the general public alike. Apple already has a massive lead in the consumer tablet market it almost single-handedly created, and the eco-system the iPad 2 lands in is perhaps it's greatest asset, with movies, books, music and the widest array of apps and games available all on tap. Starting to cater to those who wish to use their iPad as a content creation device as well as a entertainment hub, the iPad 2 will deservedly keep the iPad name synonymous with tablet computing in the public's mind, amd this white version is bound to prove highly popular.   â€�    Manufacturer's description:  What do you do when you have the best selling tablet of all time - You make it better!  More and Less: Two cameras for FaceTime and HD video recording. The Apple dual-core A5 chip. The same 10-hour battery life. All in a thinner, lighter design. Now iPad is even more amazing. And even less like anything else.  Thinner, lighter and full of great ideas: Once you pick up iPad 2, it'll be hard to put down. That's the idea behind the all-new design. It's 33 per cent thinner and up to 15 per cent lighter, so it feels even more comfortable in your hands.2 And it makes surfing the web, checking email, watching films and reading books so natural, you might forget there's incredible technology under your fingers.   Dual-core A5 chip: Two powerful cores in one A5 chip mean iPad can do twice the work at once.3 You'll notice the difference when you're surfing the web, watching films, making FaceTime video calls, gaming and going from app to app to app. Multitasking is smoother, apps load faster and everything just works better.  Super-fast graphics: With up to nine times the graphics performance, gameplay on iPad is even smoother and more realistic. And faster graphics help apps perform better - especially those with video. You'll see it when you're scrolling through your photo library, editing video with iMovie and viewing animations in Keynote.  Battery life keeps on going. So you can too: Even with the new thinner and lighter design, iPad has the same amazing 10-hour battery life. That's enough juice for one flight across the ocean, or one film-watching all-nighter or a week's commute across town. The power-efficient A5 chip and iOS keep battery life from fading away, so you can get carried away.  Two cameras. And a big hello to FaceTime for iPad: You'll see two cameras on iPad - one on the front and one on the back. They may be tiny, but they're a big deal.  They're designed for FaceTime video calling, and they work together so you can talk to your favourite people and see them smile and laugh back at you.3 The front camera puts you and your friend face-to-face. Switch to the back camera during your video call to share where you are, who you're with or what's going on around you. If it's worth filming, let the back camera roll. It's HD, so every movie you shoot is a mini-masterpiece. And you can take wacky snapshots in Photo Booth. It's the most fun a face can have.  LED-backlit display: iPad is one big, beautiful display - 9.7 inches of high-resolution photos, films, web pages, books and more. LED backlighting makes everything you see remarkably crisp, vivid and bright. Even in places with low light, like an airplane. And there's no wrong way to hold iPad. It's designed to show off everything in portrait and landscape, so with every turn (even upside down), the display adjusts to fit. Because it uses a display technology called IPS (in-plane switching), it has a wide, 178 deg; viewing angle. Hold it up to someone across the room, or share it with someone sitting next to you, and everyone gets a brilliant view.  Multi-Touch: Technology is at its best when it feels completely natural, almost like there's no technology at all. That's Multi-Touch on iPad. You use your fingers to do everything, so everything you do - surfing the web, typing email, reading books and swiping through photos - is easier and a lot more fun. How does it work? When your fingers touch the display, it senses them using electrical fields. Then it instantly transforms your taps, swipes, pinches and flicks into lifelike actions. Just like that.  iOS 4: iOS 4 is the operating system for iPad (along with iPhone and iPod touch). It lets you browse, read and see everything just by pointing your finger. It includes all the powerful, innovative and fun built-in apps you use every day, many times a day. And it's the platform on which more than 65,000 other amazing apps have been created for iPad. It's highly secure, stable and responsive, and it's made to work seamlessly with the iPad hardware. iOS 4 is the reason no other device has yet come close to iPad.  Instant On: Pick up your iPad, press the Home button and it wakes from sleep instantly. That's because iPad features fast, efficient and reliable flash storage that lets you access data quickly. So everything effortlessly springs to life.  Wi-Fi: Every iPad is built with advanced 802.11n wireless technology. It automatically finds Wi-Fi networks, which you can join with a few taps.  Gyro, accelerometer and compass: With the built-in accelerometer, you can rotate iPad to portrait or landscape, or even upside down, and whatever you're watching, reading or seeing adjusts to fit the display. And now the accelerometer, three-axis gyroscope and compass all work together. They sense where iPad is, which direction it's facing and how it's moving. So games, maps and other apps know your every twist, turn, tilt and 360. It's an epic win for gaming. And it's just the beginning of better-than-ever iPad apps.  AirPlay: All the great stuff on your iPad - your music, photos and video - can now stream wirelessly to your HDTV and speakers via AirPlay-enabled speakers or Apple TV on a Wi-Fi network.7 With just a tap on the AirPlay icon, blast some tunes, have a film night, show off some photos or watch YouTube. And go big.  Video mirroring: Video mirroring is new for iPad and for every app, web page, presentation, video, film or photo you want to show a big audience. Just plug in the Apple Digital AV Adapter or Apple VGA Adapter (sold separately) and your HDTV or projector becomes a bigger version of your iPad. One plug, that's it. Everyone sees what's on your display ? even when you rotate iPad from portrait to landscape or zoom in and out on photos.  AirPrint. Print everything wirelessly: Print your email, photos, web pages and documents straight from your iPad over Wi-Fi.8 There's no software to download, no drivers to install and no cables to connect. With just a few taps, you can go from viewing something on the iPad screen to holding a printed copy." .

A 15-inch display full of bright ideasLED backlight technology for the MacBook Pro makes the display instantly bright and allows it to be incredibly thin. They used edge-to-edge glass not just because it looks beautiful, but because it lends structure to the display. And at the top of the screen they hid the built-in FaceTime HD camera.

Few rival laptops offer a specification that can match the MacBook Pros performance, and of those that can none is presented in such a well designed and constructed chassis." .

<http://wdc.org/resource/19> <http://schema.org/Product/description> "Panasonic has created something very special with the TH-42PZ700B. Not only is this the first 42-inch plasma TV to sport a 1,920 x 1,080 panel, but it also exhibits superior picture quality to any 42-inch HDTV I?ve seen. Feed this screen high quality, high definition sources and I guarantee you?ll be blown away, but arguably even more impressive is how well it handles low quality SD signals.    It?s a shame that the TH-42PZ700B doesn?t support 1080p 24, or in fact 1080p at all over component video, but even that can?t spoil what is a truly stunning high definition TV. Yes it?s a lot more expensive than a 42in 1080p LCD TV, but if you can afford the extra cash, you definitely won?t be disappointed." .

Its poor motion handling leaves many action sequences looking nothing short of a mess, while the sporadic appearance of a purple tinge to dark scenes is horrendously distracting whenever it occurs. Funnily enough, we don't remember these issues being represented in any of those ground-breaking TV advertisements we mentioned?" .
