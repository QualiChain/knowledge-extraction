So far, the run_all.sh script is all you need
Take a look inside for what is what and which interface to call on which port.


OTHERWISE;


sbt -Dworkspace.repository.plugin=projectFile -Dworkspace.repository.projectFile.dir=C:\DIC\WorkspaceLiDaKrA\data-integration-workspace\Workspace -Dworkspace.provider.file.dir=C:\DIC\WorkspaceLiDaKrA\data-integration-workspace\Workspace  -Dhttp.port=9005 -Dapplication.context=/silk/ -Dparsers.text.maxLength=1024K "project workbench" run


sbt -Dworkspace.repository.plugin=projectFile -Dworkspace.repository.projectFile.dir=/home/mulang/Desktop/Learning/FhG/edsa/silk-workspace/workspace -Dworkspace.provider.file.dir=/home/mulang/Desktop/Learning/FhG/edsa/silk-workspace/workspace  -Dhttp.port=9005 -Dapplication.context=/silk/ -Dparsers.text.maxLength=1024K "project workbench" run

-- REDUCED RUN VERSION ---
export TERM=xterm-color
sbt -Dhttp.port=9005 "project workbench" [-Dapplication.context=/silk/] run 

Run steps:
1. Place the Workspace in the default silk home directory ($home/.silk/workspace/) -- place the folder "edsa" in this directory so that silk can pick the workspace configs
2. Run the sbt command. If you did 1 above, the you don't need to set the options [-Dworkspace.repository.projectFile.dir | -Dworkspace.provider.file.dir]
3. Run the Skill Annotations
4. Run the Data Acquisition as shown below in section 4


Browser Link
------------------------------------

http://localhost:9005/workspace




Possible Error
---------------------------------

STEP 2: I raised some Issue at Silk Issues but resolved it as indicated below

Silk compiles and runs without errors but when I go to --> localhost:9005
I get the error:

RuntimeException: No application loader is configured. Please configure an application loader either using the play.application.loader configuration property, or by depending on a module that configures one. You can add the Guice support module by adding "libraryDependencies += guice" to your build.sbt.

Can someone help me here. Urgently needed for some project.

Thanks


Solution:
-----------------------------------
Another stupid question really as The error message already provides a solution. Should you face the error message, just do what it tells you.






STEP 3: Skill Annotation
----------------------------------
sbt -Dhttp.port=9006 run

Met this error : Failed to construct terminal; falling back to unsupported ---- `sbt console` makes `java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: "0x100"`

Try :  << export TERM=xterm-color >>, More info : https://github.com/sanori/spark-sbt/issues/4

WHEN IT RUNS

You need the GATE embedded installed
And configure the path in application.config







STEP 4: Data Acquisitions
-----------------------------------------------
Depends on the other || runs on port 9000 by default 



API Keys -- Needed by the Data Acquisition module

NEXT STEPS :

Separation of the modules
Hosting the Systems?
GET Sample output --> Sooner and send to Simon
Cross check with the diagram --> and tell which sections are OK or not.....
1. Create docker versions and deploy that.
2. Digital Ocean
