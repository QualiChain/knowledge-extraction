# SDM-RDFizer
This project presents the SDM-RDFizer, an interpreter of mapping rules that allow the transformation of (un)structured data into RDF knowledge graphs. The current version of the SDM-RDFizer assumes mapping rules are defined in the RDF Mapping Language (RML) by Dimou et al. The SDM-RDFizer implements optimized data structures and relational algebra operators that enable an efficient execution of RML triple maps even in the presence of Big data. SDM-RDFizer is able to process data from Heterogeneous data sources (CSV, JSON, RDB, XML). The results of the execution of the SDM-RDFizer has been reported in the following research reports:

- Samaneh Jozashoori and Maria-Esther Vidal. MapSDI: A Scaled-up Semantic Data Integrationframework for Knowledge Graph Creation. Accepted at the 27th International Conference on Cooperative Information Systems (CoopIS 2019). 

- David Chaves-Fraga, Kemele M. Endris, Enrique Iglesias, Oscar Corcho, and Maria-Esther Vidal. What are the Parameters that Affect the Construction of a Knowledge Graph?. Accepted at the 18th International Conference on Ontologies, DataBases, and Applications of Semantics (ODBASE 2019).

The SDM-RDFizer is used in the creation of the knowledge graphs of the EU H2020 projects iASiS (http://project-iasis.eu/) and BigMedilytics - lung cancer pilot (https://www.bigmedilytics.eu/)

# About and Authors
The SDM-RDFizer has been developed by members of the Scientific Data Management Group at TIB, as an ongoing research effort. The development is coordinated and supervised by Maria-Esther Vidal (maria.vidal@tib.eu). We strongly encourage you to please report any issues you have with the SDM-RDFizer. You can do that over our contact email or creating a new issue here on Github. The SDM-RDFizer has been implemented by

# RML-Test Cases
See the results of the SDM-RDFizer over the RML test-cases at the [RML Implementation Report](http://rml.io/implementation-report/)

# Installing and Running the SDM-RDFizer 
The SDM-RDFizer can run by building a docker container or by installing the RDFfizer locally. 


## Accessing the SDM-RDFizer via a Docker Container

```
docker build -t rdfizer .
```

Run the Application

```
docker run -p 4000:80 rdfizer
```

Send a POST request with the configuration file to RDFizer the file

```
localhost:4000/graph_creation/path/to/config/file
```

## Accessing the SDM-RDFizer locally

```
python3 rdfizer/run_rdfizer.py /path/to/config/confFILE
```

# Parameters to Run the SDM-RDFizer
The SDM-RDFizer receives as input a configuration file that indicates the location of the RML triple maps and the output RDF knowledge graph. This file indicates the values of additional variables required during the process of RDF knowledge graph creation:
```
main_directory: path to where the file RML triple maps are located. 
```
```
number_of_datasets: number of datasets to be semantified
```

```
output_folder: path and file where the output RDF knowledge graph will be stored
```

```
all_in_one_file: in case multiple datasets are semantified, if the resulting RDF knowledge graphs will be stored in one or multiple file. Options: yes: all the RDF triples will be stored in one file; no: otherwise.
```

```
remove_duplicate: indicates if duplicates will be removed from the output RDF knowledge graph. Options: yes: duplicated RDF triples will be eliminated; no: otherwise.
```

```
name: name of the file that will store the integrated RDF knowledge graph, whenever the all_in_one_file option is yes.
```

```
enrichment: If optimized duplicate removal functionalities are turned on or off. Options: yes: optimized duplicate removal functionalities are turned on; no: otherwise.
```
For each dataset I, an entry of the datasetI needs to be defined; the variables to be defined are as follows:

```
name: name of the file that will store the RDF knowledge graph resulting from executing the mappings indicated in the variable mapping in the entry datasetI.
```
```
mapping: location of the file where the RML triple maps are defined and will be executed over the dataset in the entry datasetI.
```
```
dbType: the type of database management system from where data is collected. Options: mysql, postgres
```
## Example of a confFILE for accessing two CSV datasets and one RDF knowledge graph is created

This configuration file indicates that one RDF knowledge graphs will be created from the execution of the RDF triple maps
${default:main_directory}/mappingDataset1.ttl and  ${default:main_directory}/mappingDataset2.ttl. Duplicates are eliminated in the RDF knowledge graph.

```
[default]
main_directory: /path/to/datasets

[datasets]
number_of_datasets: 2
output_folder: ${default:main_directory}/graph
all_in_one_file: yes
remove_duplicate: yes
enrichment: yes
name: OutputRDFkg1

[dataset1]
mapping: ${default:main_directory}/mappingDataset1.ttl 

[dataset2]
mapping: ${default:main_directory}/mappingDataset2.ttl 
```
